# Somerville

## Description

Heroku Link: http://somerville.herokuapp.com/

A personalized tourism site for the city of Somerville where users can explore and plan activities based on neighborhood. If signed in, a user has access to a trip dashboard. Users can select a neighborhood and are randomly given activities which they can choose to add to a trip.  

I utilized React to give users a smooth and seamless experience when creating trips, adding activities to trips, and selecting former trips to continue working on. In addition, I used Google Places API, Google Maps API, and Google Charts for information and data visualization that shows the usage percentage of a specific activity added across a user's trips.
